<p>Back in April, I gave a talk at the first <a href="https://twitter.com/PHPDublin">PHP Dublin</a> meetup (<a href="https://blog.logentries.com/2013/04/inaugural-php-dublin-meetup-at-engineyard/">write up</a>) at Engine Yard's Dublin office. The talk was on adding realtime functionality to existing PHP apps&mdash;a process I went through in building <a href="http://www.thetaboard.com">ThetaBoard</a>.</p>
<p>A month and a half later, I've finally gotten around to putting up my slides and example code from the talk. Hope someone finds it useful.</p>
